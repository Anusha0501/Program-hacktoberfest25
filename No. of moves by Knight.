Program for No. of moves by Knight can make.
Given an 8*8 empty chessboard in which a knight is placed at a position (X, Y). Your task is to find the number of positions in the chessboard knight can jump into in a single move .
Note:- Rows and Columns are numbered through 1 to N.
Input:-
Knight() that take integers X and Y as arguments.
Constraints:-
1 <= X <= 8
1 <= Y <= 8
Output:-
Return the number of positions Knight can jump into in a single move.

python code:-
def Knight(X,Y):
    moves = [(2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1),(1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)]
    valid_moves = 0

    for move in moves:
        newX = X + move[0]
        newY = Y + move[1]
        if 1 <= newX <= 8 and 1 <= newY <= 8:
            valid_moves += 1

    return valid_moves
X,Y=map(int,input().split())
print(Knight(X,Y))
